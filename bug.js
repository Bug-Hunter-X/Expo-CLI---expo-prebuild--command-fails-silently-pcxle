While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the `expo prebuild` command. The error message was not very informative, simply stating that the prebuild process failed without specifying the cause. This happened consistently across different platforms (iOS and Android). The project structure and code were seemingly correct, and other Expo commands were working without issue. I checked the Expo CLI version, ensured all dependencies were up-to-date and tried a fresh project, but the error persisted.
