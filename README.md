# Expo CLI: `expo prebuild` Command Fails Silently

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo CLI's `expo prebuild` command. The command fails without providing a helpful error message, making debugging difficult.  This issue affects both iOS and Android builds.

## Bug Description

The `expo prebuild` command unexpectedly fails without any clear indication of the cause. Standard troubleshooting steps (checking dependencies, CLI version, creating a new project) did not resolve the problem.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo prebuild`.
4. Observe the silent failure of the command.

## Solution

The solution often involves identifying and resolving underlying issues within your project's configuration or dependencies.  Please refer to `bugSolution.js` for a potential solution strategy that involves thoroughly checking the project's configuration, dependencies and build settings.  This may include reviewing the `app.json` and `package.json` files for any potential conflicts or errors. In some cases, a clean install or rebuild of node modules is effective.  Consider checking your Expo SDK version as well as any third-party libraries for compatibility problems.
