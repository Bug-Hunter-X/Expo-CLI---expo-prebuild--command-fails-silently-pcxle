The root cause of the silent `expo prebuild` failure can vary.  A systematic approach is needed.  Here's a breakdown of the debugging strategy:

1. **Verify Project Configuration:** Carefully review your `app.json` and `package.json` for any typos, conflicts, or outdated dependencies. Ensure your Expo SDK version is compatible with your project's requirements and other libraries.   Look specifically for any missing or misconfigured plugin or native module entries.

2. **Clean Installation:** Delete your `node_modules` folder and reinstall your project's dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`. This ensures that all dependencies are correctly installed and that there aren't any lingering issues from previous installations.

3. **Check for Conflicting Dependencies:**  Analyze your `package.json` file and look for dependencies that might be in conflict. Use a tool like `npm-check-updates` to find outdated packages and update them.  Also, check for libraries that have known issues with Expo or the current Expo SDK version.

4. **Examine Build Logs:**  Although the `expo prebuild` command itself is not providing useful error messages, there might be log information from underlying processes. Try running `expo prebuild --verbose` for more detailed output.  Check the system logs for your OS.  Sometimes the error will bubble up in those logs.

5. **Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:** Create a new Expo project and progressively add the components of your original project until you identify the source of the problem. This helps isolate the specific part of your code or configuration that is causing the issue.

6. **Check Expo SDK and CLI Versions:** Make sure you are using the latest and stable version of the Expo SDK and CLI.  Outdated versions may contain bugs that could lead to this problem. Update using `expo upgrade` or `npm install -g expo-cli@latest`

7. **Search for Similar Issues:**  Search on the Expo forums, Github issues, and Stack Overflow for similar problems reported by other developers.  This could provide insights and potential solutions.

By methodically working through these steps, you increase your chance of pinpointing the source of the `expo prebuild` failure.
